# MaxSchemSize: 5120 (In bytes)
# MaxTries: 60 (Bridons algorithm tries to find a suitable next point for a tree. The narrower/smaller the selection and larger the radius the less likely a point is found per try.
# So too low of a value will leave holes, while too high and speed will be slower. I suggest you don't touch the number of tries.
